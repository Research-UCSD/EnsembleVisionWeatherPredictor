    "\n",
    "Thank you for participating in this exciting challenge focused on building machine learning models to emulate complex climate systems.  \n",
    "This notebook is provided as a **starter template** to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to load and preprocess the dataset  \n",
    "- Construct a baseline model  \n",
    "- Train and evaluate predictions using a PyTorch Lightning pipeline  \n",
    "- Format your predictions for submission to the leaderboard  \n",
    "\n",
    "You're encouraged to:\n",
    "- Build on this structure or replace it entirely\n",
    "- Try more advanced models and training strategies\n",
    "- Incorporate your own ideas to push the boundaries of what's possible\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in developing within a repository structure and/or use helpful tools like configuration management (based on Hydra) and logging (with Weights & Biases), we recommend checking out the following Github repo. Such a structure can be useful when running multiple experiments and trying various research ideas.\n",

    "### ⚡ ClimateEmulationModule: Lightning Wrapper for Climate Model Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core model wrapper built with **PyTorch Lightning**, which organizes the training, validation, and testing logic for the climate emulation task. Lightning abstracts away much of the boilerplate code in PyTorch-based deep learning workflows, making it easier to scale models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`training_step` / `validation_step` / `test_step`**: Standard Lightning hooks for computing loss and predictions at each stage. The loss used is **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization-aware outputs**:\n",
    "  - During validation and testing, predictions and targets are denormalized before evaluation using stored mean/std statistics.\n",
    "  - This ensures evaluation is done in real-world units (Kelvin and mm/day).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metric Evaluation** via `_evaluate()`:\n",
    "  For each variable (`tas`, `pr`), it calculates:\n",
    "  - **Monthly Area-Weighted RMSE**\n",
    "  - **Time-Mean RMSE** (RMSE on 10-year average's)\n",
    "  - **Time-Stddev MAE** (MAE on 10-year standard deviation; a measure of temporal variability)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  These metrics reflect the competition's evaluation criteria and are logged and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kaggle Submission Writer**:\n",
    "  After testing, predictions are saved to a `.csv` file in the required Kaggle format via `_save_submission()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Saving Predictions for Visualization**:\n",
    "  - Validation predictions are saved tao `val_preds.npy` and `val_trues.npy`\n",
    "  - These can be loaded later for visual inspection of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " 🔧 **Feel free to modify any part of this module** (loss functions, evaluation, training logic) to better suit your model or training pipeline / Use pure PyTorch etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ The **final submission `.csv` file must strictly follow the format and naming convention used in `_save_submission()`**, as these `ID`s are used to match predictions to the hidden test set during evaluation.\n",
