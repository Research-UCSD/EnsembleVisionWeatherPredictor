# EnsembleVisionWeatherPredictor
Vision Transformer Based Neural Network Weather Prediction Model

We developed models on our own in self-contained jupyer notebooks. Ideally we would've turned them into python files (utils, models, etc) with a requirements.txt for a conda env, 
but datahub and AWS made everything difficult and we opted for the path of least resistance. Additionaly, the repo wasn't really utilized in development as everyone solo-developed on
models in different files, so files were only pushed when other team members needed access.

Ultimately, this repo is very disorganized, but it does reflect the solo-development nature of the different models, and our problems with datahub/AWS.
